/**
 * @class  TerrainRadiationSimple
 * @brief Simple guess of terrain reflected radiation.
 * For each cell of the domain, a sky view factor is computed over 32 sectors and a 500m distance (see for example
 * Faron S. Anslow, Steven Hostetler, William R. Bidlake, and Peter U. Clark, <i>"Distributed energy balance modeling
 * of South Cascade Glacier, Washington and assessment of model uncertainty"</i>, Journal of Geophysical Research, vol. 113, 2008).
 * Then, for each cell of the domain, this view factor is transformed into a terrain view factor, multiplied by the albedo of the current
 * cell and multiplied by the sum of the direct and diffuse radiation for the current cell. This is considered to be an approximation
 * of the short wave radiation rewflected by the surroundings of the current cell.
