/**
 * @page grid_resampling Grid resampling overview
 * In addition to spatial interpolations (from stations or grids with different resolutions) it is also possible to temporally resample grids.
 * Hence, if a set of grids is available at certain dates (from weather models for example), a number of resampling algorithms can be
 * configured to provide data at dates/times in between.
 *
 * @section grid_resampling_section Grid resampling section
 * First, grid resampling must be enabled by setting the REGRIDDING_STRATEGY to GRID_1DINTERPOLATE in the [InputEditing] section.
 * Note that this currently forces the path through the temporal resampling (regridding) algorithms, and any spatial resampling
 * configured (from point timeseries) will not take action.
 * Then, grid resampling is configured in the [GridInterpolations1D] section for each meteo parameter separately.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * [InputEditing]
 * REGRIDDING_STRATEGY = GRID_1DINTERPOLATE
 *
 * [GridInterpolations1D]
 * TA::RESAMPLE = LINEAR
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section grid_algorithms_available Available Grid resampling algorithms
 * The following grid resampling algorithms are implemented:
 * - NEAREST: nearest neighbour resampling, see GridNearestResampling
 * - LINEAR: linear data resampling, see GridLinearResampling
 * - TIMESERIES: extract time series at all grid points and use Interpolations1D algorithm, see GridTimeseriesResampling
 *
 * @note By default, linear resampling will be used. It is possible to enable/disable all resampling with the ENABLE_GRID_RESAMPLING key
 * (in the [GridInterpolations1D] section). You can make MeteoIO write all grids that were resampled/regridded this way to the file system
 * by setting WRITE_RESAMPLED_GRIDS = TRUE (also in [GridInterpolations1D]).
