    /**
     * @brief This class is designed to handle interpolation (resampling) of data using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
     * model
     *
     * @details It uses the InterpolARIMA class to perform interpolation using ARIMA, with model selection and fitting done with the <a
     * href="https://github.com/rafat/ctsa/tree/master">ctsa</a> (BSD-3 Clause, see below) library. That implements the auto ARIMA algorithm
     * from <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i03">Hyndman and Khandakar (2008)</a>.
     *
     * Gaps in the data are detected and interpolated using the ARIMA model. If available, data before and after the gap is used to fit an
     * ARIMA model each,
     * one model predicting the gap forward in time, the other backward in time. A weighted average of the two predictions is then used as
     * interpolated value.
     * If only data is available before or after the gap, only one model is fitted and used for a prediction, either forward or backward in
     * time.
     *
     * The ARIMA model needs constant sampling rates, therefore the most likely rate is calculated in the data used to fit, and the data is
     * resampled to that sampling rate. If a requested point falls in between available data, it will be linearly interpolated.
     *
     * Missing values in the data used to fit the ARIMA Model, will be linearly interpolated as well.
     *
     * A gap is defined as a period of missing data, that has at least 2 data points with the most likely sampling rate. Only 1 missing data
     * point is linearly interpolated (should maybe just return instead).
     *
     * As ARIMA is a stochastic process (white noise errors are an inherent part of the model), "prediction" needs to be specified. Here we
     * call it a simulation,
     * when we draw a random error for each timestep, and use the ARIMA equations (see below) to predict the proceeding values. A
     * "prediction" is
     * essentially the mean of many simulations, including a standard deviation (see Figure 1). As interpolated values, we only use the
     * mean, as
     * this is the most likely missing value, and not subject to a possible random divergence.
     * 
     * @note The automatic search for the correct ARIMA model can be varyingly successfull. If it does not work, try setting the parameters manually.
     * @note You might get asked to increase the window size by a big amount, mostly when extrapolation should be done, because then the maximum of possible extrapolation steps is calculated, which might be bigger than your window size

     * @note When setting the parameters manually, please provide a seasonal period, as this will now not be estimated anymore, and per default assumed to be 0.
     * 
     * @note BEWARE: The algorithm will accumulate all available data in the before and after window, so if there is another gap in this window, which might also be outside of the 
     * specified resampling area, it will just linearly interpolate the data.
     * 
     * @note The accumulation window of the data, i.e. the BEFORE_WINDOW and AFTER_WINDOW, should be chosen carefully. It has a big impact on the performance, as this will be what the ARIMA model will see.

     * @section intro_arima Introduction to ARIMA
     *
     * Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a method for forecasting on historic data. It assumes a stochastic process, with
     * errors that are uncorrelated and have a mean of zero. The ARIMA model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA)
     * which assumes
     * stationary (statistically stable over time) data. Autoregressive refers to a prediciton based on past values of the data. Integrated
     * refers to
     * the differencing of the data to make it stationary. Moving average refers to the use of past errors.
     *
     * To account for seasonality of the data this model can be extended to Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). See the <a
     * href="https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-forecasting-with-arima-sarima-and-sarimax-ee61099e78f6#:~:text=SARIMA%20models%20allow%20for%20differencing,search%20frameworks%20such%20as%20pmdarina."
     * >following article</a> for more information.
     *
     * @subsection model Model Formulation
     *
     * @subsubsection AR Autoregressive (AR) Component:
     *
     *  The autoregressive component of order p (denoted as AR(p)) represents the correlation between the current observation and its
     *      \f$p\f$ past observations. The general formula for AR(\f$p\f$) is:
     *
     *      \f[
     *          Y_t = \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + a_t
     *      \f]
     *
     *  Here:
     *
     *  - \f$Y_t\f$ is the value at time t,
     *
     *  - \f$\phi_t\f$ are the autoregressive coefficients,
     *
     *  - \f$Y_{t-i}\f$ are the past observations,
     *
     *  - \f$a_t is\f$ a white noise term (random error) at time
     *
     * @subsubsection Int Integrated (I) Component:
     *
     *  The integrated component of order \f$d\f$ (denoted as I(\f$d\f$)) is responsible for differencing the time series data to achieve
     *      stationarity. The differenced series is denoted as \f$\mathbf{Y'}\f$ and is defined as:
     *
     *  \f[
     *      Y'_t = Y_t - Y_{t-d}
     *  \f]
     *
     *  Repeat differencing d times until stationarity is achieved.
     *
     * @subsubsection ma Moving Average (MA) Component:
     *
     *  The moving average component of order \f$q\f$ (denoted as MA(\f$q\f$)) represents the correlation between the current observation
     * and
     *      \f$q\f$ past white noise terms. The general formula for MA(\f$q\f$) is:
     *
     *  \f[
     *      Y_t = a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1} - \theta_2 a_{t-2} - \ldots - \theta_q a_{t-q}
     *  \f]
     *
     *  Here:
     *
     *  - \f$\theta\f$ are the moving average coefficients,​
     *
     *  - \f$a_{t-q}\f$ are the past white noise terms.
     *
     *
     * @subsubsection arima ARIMA(p, d, q) Model:
     * Combining the AR, I, and MA components, an ARIMA(\f$p, d, q\f$) model is expressed as:
     *
     *  \f[
     *      Y'_t = \phi_1 Y'_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y'_{t-2} + \ldots + \phi_p Y'_{t-p} + a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1} - \theta_2 a_{t-2} - \ldots -
     * \theta_q a_{t-q}
     *  \f]
     *
     * @subsection estimation Parameter Estimation
     *
     * The parameters of the model are estimated by either maximising the likelihood function or minimising the sum of squared errors.
     *  The likelihood function measures the probability of observing the given data given the model parameters. Optimization is done using
     *  optimization routines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno_algorithm">BFGS</a>  or the <a
     *  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder–Mead_method">Nelder-Mead</a> method.
     *
     *  Maximum Likelihood estimation usually gives better results but is computationally more expensive. As default a mix between the two:
     *  CSS-MLE is used, with BFGS to optimize:
     *
     * @code
     * TA::ARIMA::LIK_METHOD = CSS-MLE
     * TA::ARIMA::OPT_METHOD = BFGS
     * @endcode
     *
     *
     * @subsection selection Model Selection
     * Usually, the parameter selection (p, d, q)(P,D,Q) is done by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion <a
     * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion">AIC</a> or the Bayesian Information Criterion <a
     * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion">BIC</a>.
     * Which parameterize the goodness of a fit. Either an extensive search is done, i.e. all possible combinations between p=0...max_P,
     * q=0...max_Q, ... are tried. Or a stepwise search is done, following the Implementation of <a
     * href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i03">Hyndman and Khandakar (2008)</a>.
     *
     * As default a stepwise search is done. Additionally, an approximation of the ICs can be used to speed up the search, and the maxima of
     * the parameters can be chosen as well.
     *
     * @code
     * TA::ARIMA::STEPWISE = TRUE
     * TA::ARIMA::APPROXIMATION = TRUE
     * TA::ARIMA::MAX_P = 8
     * TA::ARIMA::MAX_D = 3
     * .
     * .
     * .
     * @endcode
     *
     *
     * In the case of a known seasonal period, e.g. yearly cycles, the seasonal component can be added to the model, by setting the seasonal
     * period (in seconds), if it is 0 it will be estimated automatically (not always reliable):
     * @code
     * TA::ARIMA::SEASONAL_PERIOD = 31536000
     * @endcode
     *
     * Not yet implemented:
     * If you are familiar with finding the best ARIMA parameters via the PACF and ACF plots, you can also set the parameters manually:
     * @code
     * TA::ARIMA::P = 2
     * TA::ARIMA::D = 1
     * TA::ARIMA::Q = 2
     * TA::ARIMA::P_SEASONAL = 1
     * TA::ARIMA::D_SEASONAL = 1
     * TA::ARIMA::Q_SEASONAL = 1
     * @endcode
     *
     * @subsection forecasting Forecasting and Interpolation
     *
     * Forecasting is then done by using the fitted model on the available data, and predicting the next time steps. As random errors are
     * needed, a prediction
     * will return the mean of predicted values, and not a single simulation (one draw of the random error).
     *
     * If data is available before and after a gap, two ARIMA models are fitted, one to predict forward the other to predict backward in
     * time. A weighted
     * average will then be computed and then used as actual prediction.
     *
     * As the ARIMA model only works with constant sampling rates, the data is resampled to the most likely sampling rate. If a requested
     * point falls in between available data, it will be linearly interpolated.
     *
     * \image html arima_simulation.png "Figure 1: Prediction and Simulation using an ARIMA model."
     * 
     * The cyan line is the prediction (mean)
     * with standard deviation (blue 1\f$\sigma\f$ and red 2\f$\sigma\f$). The Blue and Red lines show two simulations, each with a different
     * draw of random errors.
     * 
     * \image html arima_interpolation.png "Figure 2: Interpolation using an ARIMA model."
     * 
     * Green shows the data given to the Interpolation
     * Algorithm, in blue its output. And orange the original test data.
     *
     *
     * @note The performance of the ARIMA model can vary and also depends on the given data. In general the more data the better, and when
     * computing time is not
     * an issue an extensive search might be useful
