/**
 * @brief Generate daily variations around a single daily average.
 * @details
 * The parameter to be interpolated is assumed to be a daily average and a sinusoidal variation of the
 * data will be generated around this average.
 *
 * Either one or two additional parameters bearing the same name followed by "_MIN" and/or "_MAX"
 * are provided or a fixed amplitude is provided as argument (it will also be used as a fallback if the _MIN and
 * _MAX parameters are missing at some timesteps). Iit is also possible to provide the "phase" or the
 * fraction of the day when the minimum is reached.
 *
 * @code
 * [Interpolations1D]
 * TA::resample         = daily_avg
 * TA::daily_avg::range = 5
 * TA::daily_avg::phase = .25                ;assume that TA varies +/- 5K around its average during the day and reaches its minimum at 6am
 * @endcode
 * @note If both the average (the parameter itself in the data set),
 * min and max are provided, an error message will be returned.
