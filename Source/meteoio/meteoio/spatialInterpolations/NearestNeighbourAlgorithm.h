 * This can be specially useful for virtual stations, as it guarantee that the spatially interpolated data is measured data. On the other hand, this creates spatial discontinuities when
 * moving from one station to another one. Furthermore, please keep in mind that when this algorithm is enabled, it has the highest priority as soon as at least one station is available.
