 * @class ALS_Interpolation
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Scale and distribute the precipitation according to Airborn Laser Scans (ALS) grids.
 * @details
 * This assumes that precipitation fields can be scaled according to
 * snow heights grids in order to get improved precipitation patterns (see <i>"Scaling Precipitation Input to Spatially Distributed Hydrological Models 
 * by Measured Snow Distribution"</i>, C. VÃ¶geli, M. Lehning, N. Wever, M. Bavay, 2016, Front. Earth Sci. <b>4</b>: 108. 
 * <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2016.00108">doi: 10.3389/feart.2016.00108.</a>). 
 * 
 * In a first step, the precipitation are spatially distributed with a <i>base</i> method and in a second step the resulting grid is modified to reflect the
 * spatial distribution of the provided snow height grid. Of course, these two steps happen automatically and transparently to the caller of this
 * algorithm.
 * 
 * It takes the following arguments:
 *  - BASE: the base method to fill the grid (for example, idw_lapse (default));
 *  - GRID: the name of the file (in GRID2DPATH) containing the gridded ALS data (relying on the GRID2D plugin). This must provide 
 * a snow height map that will be used to scale the precipitation patterns.
 *  - TA_THRESH: an optional air temperature threshold (in K) below which such redistribution occurs
 * (so liquid precipitation is not redistributed)
 *
 * @note If there are some time steps when only one station provides the necessary parameter, the base method will
 * automatically switch to "AVG".
 *
 * @code
 * PSUM::algorithms        = ALS_SCALING
 * PSUM::als_scaling::base = idw_lapse
 * PSUM::als_scaling::grid = als_20150213.asc
