 * @class StandardPressureAlgorithm
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Standard atmospheric pressure interpolation algorithm.
 * @details
 * This first fills the grid with the standard atmosphere's pressure, depending on the local elevation. Then, depending on the available data:
 *     - if there are no measured atmospheric pressure, nothing else happens;
 *     - if one station has measured local atmospheric pressure, its offset to the standard atmospheric pressure is computed and applied to
 *       the computed grid;
 *     - if multiple stations have measured local atmospheric pressure:
 *                - default: the average offset will be applied to the computed grid;
 *                - USE_RESIDUALS option set to TRUE: the residuals are computed at each station, spatially distributed (with IDW)
 * and applied to the computed grid. Therefore the following extra arguments are supported:
 *                       - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *                       - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 *
 * @code
 * P::algorithms               = STD_PRESS
 * P::Std_Press::USE_RESIDUALS = true
 * @endcode
