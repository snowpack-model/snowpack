/**
 * @class WinstralAlgorithm
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief DEM-based wind-exposure interpolation algorithm.
 * @details
 * This is an implementation of the method described in Winstral, Elder, & Davis,
 * <i>"Spatial snow modeling of wind-redistributed snow using terrain-based parameters"</i>, 2002,
 * Journal of Hydrometeorology, <b>3(5)</b>, 524-538.
 * The DEM is used to compute wind exposure factors that are used to alter the precipitation fields.
 * It is usually a good idea to provide a DEM that also contain the accumulated snow height in order
 * to get a progressive softening of the terrain features.
 *
 * It takes the following arguments:
 *  - BASE:: provide the base algorithm to pre-fill the grid, since this method must first use another algorithm to
 * generate an initial precipitation field, and then modify it. By default, this base method is "idw_lapse" and switches to
 * "avg" if only one station can provide the precipitation at a given time step (for an easy fallback). Please do not forget
 * to provide any necessary arguments for this base method!
 *  - TYPE: specify how the synoptic wind direction is derived. It is either of the following:
 *     - AUTO: automatic computation of the synoptic wind direction (default, see below);
 *     - FIXED: provide a fixed synoptic wind bearing that is used for all time steps. It then needs the following argument:
 *          - DW_SYNOP: fixed synoptic wind bearing that is used for all time steps;
 *     - REF_STATION: the wind direction at the provided station is assumed to be the synoptic wind direction. It then needs the following argument:
 *          - REF_STATION: the station ID providing the wind direction;
 *  - DMAX: maximum search distance or radius (default: 300m);
 *
 * If type=AUTO, the synoptic wind direction will be computed as follow:
 * the stations are located in the DEM and their wind shading (or exposure) is computed. If at least one station is found
 * that is not sheltered from the wind (in every direction), it provides the synoptic wind (in case of multiple stations, the
 * vector average is used). Please note that the stations that are not included in the DEM are considered to be sheltered.
 * If no such station is found, the vector average of all the available stations is used.
 *
 * @code
 * PSUM::algorithms         = WINSTRAL
 * PSUM::winstral::base     = idw_lapse
 * PSUM::winstral::type     = fixed
 * PSUM::winstral::dw_synop = 180
 * PSUM::winstral::dmax     = 300
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Another example, using non-default values for the base algorithm:
 * @code
 * PSUM::ALGORITHMS = WINSTRAL IDW_LAPSE
 * PSUM::WINSTRAL::BASE = idw_lapse
 * PSUM::WINSTRAL::DMAX = 300
 * PSUM::WINSTRAL::TYPE = AUTO
 * 
 * PSUM::IDW_LAPSE::SOFT = TRUE
 * PSUM::IDW_LAPSE::TREND_MIN_ALT = 500.0
 * PSUM::IDW_LAPSE::TREND_MAX_ALT = 1500.0
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @remarks Only cells with an air temperature below freezing participate in the redistribution
