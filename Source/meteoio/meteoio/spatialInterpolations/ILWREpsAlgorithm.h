/**
 * @class ILWREpsAlgorithm
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Incoming Long Wave Radiation interpolation algorithm.
 * @details
 * Each ILWR is converted to an emissivity (using the local air temperature), interpolated using IDW_LAPSE and reconverted to ILWR. As
 * a side effect, the user must have defined algorithms to be used for air temperature (since this is needed for emissivity to ILWR conversion).
 * The lapse rate definition arguments as parsed by Trend::Trend() are supported (but keep in mind <b><i>these apply to the emissivity</i></b>, not to the ILWR!)
 * as well as the following arguments:
 *  - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *  - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 *
 * @note the emissivity variation is not linear with elevation, but it is possible to derive some approximate lapse rate for the elevation on interest, for example from
 * Centeno, M. <i>"New formulae for the equivalent night sky emissivity"</i>, 1982, Solar Energy, <b>28(6)</b>, 489-498 (watch out, an exponent is wrong in quation 13 page 491).
 * A better approach would be to use a power function to fit the emissivity as a function of the elevation...
 *
 * @code
 * ILWR::algorithms = ILWR_EPS
 * ILWR::ilwr_eps::soft = true
 * ILWR::ilwr_eps::rate = -1.8e-5 ;around 2000m elevation
 * @endcode
