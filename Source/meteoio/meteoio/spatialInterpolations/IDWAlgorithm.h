/**
 * @class IDWAlgorithm
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation algorithm.
 * @details
 * Each cell receives the weighted average of the whole data set with weights being 1/rÂ²
 * (r being the distance of the current cell to the contributing station) and renormalized
 * (so that the sum of the weights is equal to 1.0).
 * It takes the following arguments:
 *  - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *  - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 *
 * @note If IDW is applied on wind speed (VW, VW_MAX or VW_DRIFT) or wind direction (DW),
 * the algorithm internally applies the interpolation on the wind speed components individually,
 * if both wind speed and direction are available at the same station.
