/**
 * @class USERInterpolation
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Reads user provided gridded data on the disk.
 * @details
 * By default, the grids are all in the GRID2DPATH directory given in the [Input] section and the file extension is assumed to
 * be ".asc". But the following arguments allow overriding it:
 *  - SUBDIR: look for grids in the provided subdirectory of GRID2DPATH;
 *  - EXT: use another file extension.
 *  - NAMING: provide file name template using YYYY for year, MM for month, DD for day, hh for hour, mm for minute, ss for second (optional) and PARAM for parameter name.
 *		Examples:
 *		- param::user::naming = YYYYMMDDhhmmss_PARAM (default) searches for files named: <b>{numeric date with second resolution}_{capitalized meteo parameter}.{ext}</b>, for example 20081201150000_TA.asc.
 *		- TA::user::naming = YYYY-MM-DDThh.mm_PARAM searches for files named 2008-12-01T15.00_TA.asc.
 *  - TIME_CONSTANT: if true, use the same grid for all timesteps (default: false). If TIME_CONSTANT is set to true, files must be named according to:
 *    <b>{capitalized meteo parameter}.{ext}</b>, for example TA.asc.
 *  - REGRID: if true, allows for regridding of the grids to match the DEM, using bilinear interpolation.
 * Grids may differ in coverage and cell size with the DEM, but must be in the same coordinate system. If false, an error will be thrown if the georeferencing of the grid does not match the DEM.
 *
 *  If no grid exists for a given timestamp and parameter, the algorithm returns a zero rating so any other interpolation algorithm can pickup
 * and provide a fallback. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide grids for all time steps but one can focuss on only the relevant and interesting
 * time steps. The following argument changes this behavior:
 *  - LOWEST_PRIORITY: by default, when a user provided grid exists it will have priority over any other interpolation algorithm. Setting LOWEST_PRIORITY 
 * to TRUE gives user provided grids the lowest priority so such grids are only used when no other spatial interpolation algorithm can provide interpolations.
 *
 * The meteo parameters can be found in \ref meteoparam "MeteoData". Examples of use:
 * @code
 * TA::algorithms = USER	# read grids from GRID2DPATH using the GRID2D plugin
 *
 * VW::algorithms   = USER	# read grids from GRID2DPATH/wind
 * VW::user::subdir = wind
 *
 * PSUM::algorithms   = USER	# read grids from GRID2DPATH/precip with the ".dat" extension
 * PSUM::user::subdir = precip
 * PSUM::user::ext    = .dat
 * PSUM::user::naming = YYYY-MM-DDThh.mm.ss_PARAM
 * PSUM::user::regrid = true
 *
 * TSG::algorithms    = USER     # read grids from GRID2DPATH using the GRID2D plugin
 * TSG::user::ext     = .asc
 * TSG::user::time_constant  = TRUE  # use the same grid for all timesteps.
 * @endcode
