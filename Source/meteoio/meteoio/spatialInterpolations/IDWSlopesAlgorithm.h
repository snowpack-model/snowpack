/**
 * @class IDWSlopesAlgorithm
 * @brief Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation with splitted N/E/S/W slopes and flats.
 * @details
 * This is designed around the data produced by the Snowpack model: each station produces virtual slopes
 * (38Â°) for each of the main 4 aspects. This algorithm interpolates each N/E/S/W group of stations separately
 * (IDW with elevation lapse rate) and then recombines them with weights that depend on the cell's slope and aspect.
 * It takes the following arguments:
 *  - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *  - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 * @ingroup spatialization
