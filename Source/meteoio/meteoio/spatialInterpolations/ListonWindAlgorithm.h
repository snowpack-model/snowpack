/**
 * @class ListonWindAlgorithm
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Curvature/slope influenced wind interpolation algorithm.
 * @details
 * This is an implementation of the method described in G. E. Liston and K. Elder,
 * <i>"A meteorological distribution system for high-resolution terrestrial modeling (MicroMet)"</i>, Journal of Hydrometeorology, <b>7.2</b>, 2006.
 * The wind speed and direction are spatially interpolated using IDWLapseAlgorithm. Then, the wind speed and
 * direction fields are altered by wind weighting factors and wind diverting factors (respectively) calculated
 * from the local curvature and slope (as taken from the DEM, see DEMObject). The wind diverting factor is
 * actually the same as in RyanAlgorithm. It takes the following arguments:
 *  - ETA: this is a topographic length scale (m) for calculating the curvature. Recommended is to choose this length scale equal to approximately
 *    half the wavelength of the topographic features within the domain (e.g., the distance from a typical ridge to the nearest valley) (default: equal
 *    to grid cell size).
 *  - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *  - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 *  - all the trend-controlling arguments supported by Trend::Trend().
 *
 * @code
 * VW::algorithms = LISTON_WIND
