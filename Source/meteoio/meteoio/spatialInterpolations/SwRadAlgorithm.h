 * @class SWRadInterpolation
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief %Solar radiation interpolation with optional terrain shading.
 * @details
 * The splitting coefficients and an atmospheric losses factors are computed at each station that provides ISWR and spatially interpolated
 * with an Inverse Distance Weighting scheme. Then the potential radiation is computed at each pixel and scaled appropriately with the
 * atmospheric loss factor for this pixel. When applying topographic shading (default), the local splitting coefficient is used. The global, horizontal
 * (except when using the PROJECT_ON_SLOPE option) short wave radiation is then returned. It supports the following arguments:
 *  - SHADING: if set to FALSE, turns off topographic shading (default: TRUE);
 *  - PROJECT_ON_SLOPE: if set to TRUE, the computed radiation will be projected on the slopes (default: FALSE so it returns an horizontal radiation field);
 *  - SCALE: this is a scaling parameter to smooth the IDW distribution. In effect, this is added to the distance in order
 * to move into the tail of the 1/d distribution (default: 1000m);
 *  - ALPHA: this is an exponent to the 1/d distribution (default: 1);
 *
 * @code
 * ISWR::algorithms     = SWRad
 * ISWR::SWRad::shading = true
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note For this method to work, you also need to define spatial interpolations algorithms for TA, RH and P (a basic STD_PRESS algorithm
 * is usually enough)
 * @note This algorithm is quite time consuming (specially the topographic shading) and therefore not appropriate for very large domains.
