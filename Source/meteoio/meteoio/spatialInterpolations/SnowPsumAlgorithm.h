 * @class SnowPSUMInterpolation
 * @ingroup spatialization
 * @brief Precipitation distribution according to the local slope and curvature.
 * @details
 * The precipitation distribution is initialized using a specified algorithm ("BASE" option, set to IDW_LAPSE by default, see IDWLapseAlgorithm).
 * An optional parameter can be given to specify which algorithm has to be used for initializing the grid.
 * Please do not forget to provide the arguments of the chosen algorithm itself if necessary!
 *
 * After filling the initial grid, this method modifies the solid precipitation distribution according to the local slope and curvature:
 * all pixels whose slope is greater than 60째 will not receive any snow at all. All pixels whose slope is less than 40째 will receive full snow
 * and any pixel between 40째 and 60째 sees a linear correction between 100% and 0% snow. After this step, a curvature
 * correction is applied: pixels having the minimum curvature see 50% snow more, pixels having the maximum curvature see
 * 50% snow less and pixels ate the middle of the curvature range are unaffected.
 *
 * For more, see <i>"Quantitative evaluation of different hydrological modelling approaches
 * in a partly glacierized Swiss watershed"</i>, Magnusson et Al., Hydrological Processes, <b>25</b>, 2071-2084, 2011 and
 * <i>"Modelling runoff from highly glacierized alpine catchments in a changing climate"</i>, Huss et All., Hydrological Processes, <b>22</b>, 3888-3902, 2008.
 *
 * An example using this algorithm, initializing the grid with a constant lapse rate fill using +0.05% precipitation increase per meter of elevation, is given below:
 * @code
 * PSUM::algorithms      = PSUM_SNOW
 * PSUM::psum_snow::base = avg_lapse
 * PSUM::avg_lapse::frac = true
 * PSUM::avg_lapse::rate = 0.0005
 * @endcode
