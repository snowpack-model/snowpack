/**
 * @class TauCLDGenerator
 * @ingroup parametrizations
 * @brief Atmospheric transmissivity generator.
 * @details
 * Generate the atmospheric transmissivity (or clearness index, see \ref meteoparam) from other parameters. If a parameter
 * named "CLD" is available, it will be interpreted as cloud cover / cloudiness: in okta between
 * 0 (fully clear) and 8 (fully cloudy). For synop reports, it is possible to include a value of exactly 9 (sky obstructed
 * from view by fog, heavy precipitation...) that will be transparently reset to 8 (fully cloudy).
 *
 * If no such parameter is available, the atmospheric transmissivity is calculated from the solar index
 * (ratio of measured iswr to potential iswr, therefore using the current location (lat, lon, altitude) and ISWR
 * to parametrize the cloud cover). This relies on (Kasten and Czeplak, 1980).
 *
 * It takes the following (optional) argument:
 *    - CLD_TYPE: cloudiness model, either LHOMME, KASTEN or CRAWFORD (default: KASTEN, see AllSkyLWGenerator for the references of the papers. 
 * Please also note that CRAWFORD and LHOMME are exactly identical as the both simply consider that the cloudiness is <em>1-clearness_index</em>);
 *    - SHADE_FROM_DEM: if set to true, the DEM defined in the [Input] section will be used to compute the shading;
 *    - INFILE: a file containing the horizon for some or all stations (see the ProcShade filter for the format);
 *    - OUTFILE: a file to write the computed horizons to. If some horizons have been read from INFILE, they will also be written out in OUTFILE;
 *    - USE_RSWR. If set to TRUE, when no ISWR is available but RSWR and HS are available, a ground albedo is estimated
 * (either soil or snow albedo) and ISWR is then computed from RSWR. Unfortunately, this is not very precise... (thus default is false)
 *    - USE_RAD_THRESHOLD: when relying on measured ISWR to parametrize the cloudiness, there is a risk that the measuring station would
 * stand in a place where it is shaded by the surrounding terrain at some point during the day. This would lead to an overestimation 
 * of the cloudiness that is undesirable. In this case, it is possible to set USE_RAD_THRESHOLD to TRUE in order to interpolate the cloudiness
 * over all periods of low radiation measured ISWR. This is less performant that only considering the solar elevation (with shading 
 * computed from DEM) but improves things in this specific scenario, when no shading is available.
 * 
 * \note
 * Please note that it is possible to combine SHADE_FROM_DEM and INFILE: in this case, stations that don't have any horizon in the provided
 * INFILE will be computed from DEM. It is also possible to define wildcard station ID in the horizon file. If SHADE_FROM_DEM has been set
 * to false and no INFILE has been provided, a fixed 5 degrees threshold is used.
 *
 * @code
 * [Generators]
 * TAU_CLD::generator1     = TAU_CLD
 * TAU_CLD::arg1::use_rswr = false
 * @endcode
 *
 * The horizon file contains on each line a station ID followed by an azimuth (in degrees, starting from North) and an elevation above the
 * horizontal (also in degrees). It is possible to define a wildcard station ID '*' to be used as fallback. The elevation for any given azimuth
 * will be linearly interpolated between the provided horizons before and after. If only one azimuth is given for a station ID, its horizon
 * elevation is assumed to be constant. See below an example horizon file, defining two station IDs (SLF2 and FLU2):
 * @code
 * SLF2 0 5
 * SLF2 45 25
 * SLF2 180 30
 * SLF2 245 10
 * FLU2 0 7
 * @endcode
 * 
 * \note 
 * In order to pre-compute the horizons for multiple stations, write an ini file reading all stations of interest, declare a dataGenerator 
 * that relies on TauCLDGenerator and run meteoio_timeseries on it for at least one time step. This will be enough to create the horizon file
 * for all stations...
