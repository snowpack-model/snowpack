/**
 * @class  ProcWMASmoothing
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief Weighted moving average smoothing.
 * @details
 * This implements a weighted moving average smoothing (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_moving_average#Weighted_moving_average) such as:
 * - WMA_unnormalized = 1*X1 + 2*X2 + ... + n*Xn (n being the current point)
 * - then WMA = WMA_unnormalized / sum_of_weights with sum_of_weights = 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2
 *
 *  Nodata values are excluded from the moving average calculation. It takes as arguments all the window parameters as defined in WindowedFilter::setWindowFParams();
 *
 * The standard behavior for this filter is obtained by using a left window. If using a right window, it behaves as if time was reversed
 * (ie. predictions from the future). A centered window applies the standard algorithms on the <b>distance</b> between the center point and each points,
 * that is that points get averaged symetrically around the middle point before running the standard algorithm.
 *
 * @note This filter temporally shifts the signal back by window_width/2 if using left or right window
 * @note This would probably lead to slightly unexpected results if used on irregularly sampled data
 *
 * @code
 * TA::filter1         = wma_smoothing
 * TA::arg1::soft      = FALSE
 * TA::arg1::centering = right
 * TA::arg1::min_pts   = 1
 * TA::arg1::min_span  = 1800 ;ie 1800 seconds time span for the left leaning window
 * @endcode
