/**
 * @class  ProcDeAccumulate
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief Convert accumulated values back to instantaneous values.
 * @details
 * Some radiation parameters are sometimes provided as accumulated values over a given period (such as ECMWF radiation fields). 
 * The value at any given timestep is either the instantaneous value (at the beginning of the accumulation period) or the sum of
 * the instantaneous value and the preceeding values.
 * This can be illustrated as:
 *  - at time t, the value is x1;
 *  - at time t+dt, the value is x1+dx1;
 *  - at time t+2dt, the value is x1+dx1+dx2;
 *  - at time t+3dt, the value is x2;
 *  - at time t+4dt, the value is x2+dx2;
 *  - ...
 *
 * This filter recomputes the instantaneous values by considering that once a value gets smaller than its preceding values, the
 * end of the accumulation period has been reached, so the value is kept as is and the process starts over again (thus this
 * assumes that they are no negative values). 
 *
