/**
 * @class RadProj
 * @brief Project incoming short wave radiation from any slope (angle and azimuth) to any other slope.
 * @details
 * This filter is useful to generate horizontal radiation values from measurements performed parallel to the slope
 * or to generate slope-parallel values from horizontal measurements. It can also be used to correct for a sensor that tilted 
 * over time and therefore was not parallel anymore. It takes as arguments at least one set of angle/azimuth for the source and/or the 
 * destination sensor. It can actually project from any inclination to any other inclination. In case of self shading 
 * on the source sensor, the projected values will be set to nodata.
 * 
 * It takes the following arguments:
 *    - SRC_AZI and SRC_ANGLE: the inclination parameters (azimuth in degrees north, angle in degrees 
 *      from the horizontal) from the source sensor (default: horizontal);
 *    - DEST_AZI and DEST_ANGLE: the inclination parameters (azimuth in degrees north, angle in degrees 
 *      from the horizontal) from the destination sensor (default: horizontal);
 * 
 * @note The angles and azimuth that are relevant are the ones measured at the sensor, not necessarily the slope under the sensor!
