/**
 * @class FilterTimeconsistency
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief Check that the time evolution of a given parameter is consistent with its past evolution
 * @details
 * Compare sum of differences between snow depth (HS) value and HS value before and HS value afterwards, respectively,
 *  with 4 times of the standard deviation of HS in a defined time period (something like MAD)
 * First, the standard deviation of HS is calculated for a certain time period. Afterwards, the difference between the value and 
 * the value before and the difference between the value and the following value are calculated. Then, the sum of the two 
 * differences is calculated and compared with 4 times of the standard deviation. Is the sum lower than the standard deviation, 
 * the HS value is accepted. Otherwise the HS value gets invalid. 
 * References/Literature:  Zahumensky, Igor, 2004: Guidelines on Quality Control Procedures for Data from Automatic Weather Stations, World Meteorological Organisation 
 * 
 * It takes as arguments the window parameters as defined in WindowedFilter::setWindowFParams().
 *
 * @code
 * Valid examples for the io.ini file:
 * HS::filter1         = time_consistency
 * HS::arg1::soft      = true
 * HS::arg1::centering = left
 * HS::arg1::min_pts   = 1
 * HS::arg1::min_span  = 1800 ;ie left centered window spanning 1800 seconds and at least 1 points
 *
 * TA::filter1         = time_consistency
 * TA::arg1::min_pts   = 10
 * TA::arg1::min_span  = 600 ;ie strictly centered window spanning 600 seconds and at least 10 points
