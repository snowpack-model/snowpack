/**
 * @class FilterDeGrass
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief This filter is used to distinguish if snow (HS) is on the ground or not
 * @details This is useful because the
 * ultrasonic sensor cannot distinguish between snow or vegetation/grass on the ground. 
 * The filter is based on total snow depth (HS), snow surface temperature (TSS), ground surface temperature (TSG)
 * and reflected shortwave radiation (RSWR). 
 * Different steps to do: 
 *    -# calculate possible offset of TSS (reason: at some stations in some springs the TSS increases 
 * although snow is still on the ground) 
 *    -# calculate correlation of TSS and TSG in spring (normally both temperatures increase at the same 
 * time in spring which results in a high correlation; low correlation if TSS and TSG increase not parallel 
 * which leads in connection with a high offset of TSS to the assumption, that TSS is false), then:
 *        -# if TSS has a low offset and the correlation between TSS and TSG is high, the algorithm 
 * analyses based on the daily Max/Min/Mean of TSS if snow is on the ground or not 
 *        -# if no TSS is available or the offset of TSS is high/correlation of TSS and TSG is low, the 
 * algorithm analyses based on the variance of TSG and the value of TSG if snow is on the ground or 
 * not.
 * 
 * References/Literature: Tilg, A.-M., Marty C. and G. Klein, <i>"An automatic algorithm for validating snow 
 * depth measurements of IMIS stations"</i>, 2015. Swiss Geoscience Meeting 2015
 * 
 * Normally, the filter computes any potential offset on TSS before using it in its algorithms. But it is possible
 * to provide the offset that must be used, with the optional TSS_OFFSET argument (then TSS_meas + TSS_offset is compared to given thresholds to
 * determine if snow can exist on the ground, so you can give a negative offset to more easily keep snow on the ground). 
 * 
 * Example of use:
 * @code
 * HS::filter1	= DETECT_GRASS
 * @endcode
 * 
 *\note
 * - two of the used criterias are currently only valid for mid-northern latitudes (months when the season might start);
 * - it is probably a good idea to use a FilterRate filter after this one in order to remove some potential left-over peaks.
