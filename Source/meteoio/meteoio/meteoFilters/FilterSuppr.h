/**
 * @class  FilterSuppr
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief Suppression filter.
 * @details
 * Normally, this filter simply rejects all values. This is convenient to quickly turn a parameter off
 * without modifying the original data. It is also possible to suppress some values based on
 * specific criterias, with the following arguments:
 *  - TYPE: either FILE (suppress periods provided in a separate file) or FRAC (suppress a given fraction of the data) or ALL (suppress all values for this parameter), mandatory;
 *  - FILE: provide a file that contains a list of station ID's and timesteps specifying where the parameter should be suppressed;
 *  - FRAC: suppress a given fraction of the data at random. For example, <i>0.5</i> would ensure that at least <i>50%</i> of the
 * data set contains <i>nodata</i> for this parameter. In this case, it is possible to either delete individual points at random or 
 * time periods of a given width (given by the WIDTH argument, in seconds. There will always be at least one point between two consecutive periods).
 *
 * @code
 * ILWR::filter1     = suppr
 * ILWR::arg1::type = ALL
 * 
 * PSUM::filter1     = suppr
 * PSUM::arg1::type  = FILE
 * PSUM::arg1::file = ./input/meteo/psum_suppr.dat
 * 
 * TA::filter1       = suppr
 * PSUM::arg1::type  = FRAC
 * TA::arg1::FRAC    = 0.5
 * TA::arg1::WIDTH   = ${{24*3600}}	;delete full day at once. If not defined, individual points would be deleted
 * @endcode
 * 
 * In the second example (PSUM), the file <i>psum_suppr.dat</i> would look like this (the time is given in the timezone declared in Input::TIME_ZONE):
 * @code
 * *WFJ 2015-10-01T12:00
 * *DAV 2015-10-02T15:00
 * *WFJ 2015-11-10T06:00
 * *WFJ 2015-12-25T01:00 2015-12-27T13:30
 * *WFJ 2015-09-01T07:15 - 2015-09-10T20:30
 * STB2 2015-10-01T21:30
 * @endcode
 * Time ranges are declared by providing two dates on the same line. For more visibility, the said two dates can be separated by " - " (with a white
 * space character on both sides, as shown in the example above).
