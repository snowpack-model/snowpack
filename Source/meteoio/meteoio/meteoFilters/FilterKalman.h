 * @section introduction Introduction
 *
 * @note After you have read this, some concepts are further explained in FilterParticle; references are also found there.
 * The documentation is meant to be read in conjunction.
 * @note It is advised that you have a TeX installation in place to compile this part of the documentation yourself.
 *
 * This filter suite implements a particle and a Kalman Filter.

 * __Disclaimer__: The Kalman and particle filters are <b>not</b> meant for operational use, rather they aim to be an accessible framework to
 * scientific research backed by the convenience of MeteoIO, to quickly try a few things.
 *
 * What do they do?
 *
 * Both filters follow a statistical approach. The particle filter is a _classical Monte Carlo method_ and samples states from a
 * distribution function. The Kalman filter solves matrix equations of _Bayesian statistics_ theory.
 * They solve the problem of combining model data with noisy measurements in an optimal way.

 * Who are they for?
 *
 * a) Suppose you have your toolchain set up with MeteoIO and are interested in Bayesian filters. With this software, you can
 * (relatively) easily start to explore in this direction and hopefully decide if it is an idea worth pursuing.
 *
 * b) You try a filter, play with the settings, and for whatever reason it works.
 *
 * The difference to other, easier to use, filters is that you, the user, must provide the Physics in form of analytical models and
 * covariance matrices. Almost all will be defaulted, but this may not make much sense in your use case.
 *
 * @section kalmanfilter The Kalman filter
 *
 * A Kalman filter works on a _linear state model_ which propagates an initial state forward in time. At each time step, the filter will
 * adjust this model taking into account _incoming measurements_ tainted with white (Gaussian) noise. For this, we can tune how much trust
 * we put in our measurements (initial and online), and thus how strongly the filter will react to observations.
 * @note In this scope, "online" means that new measurements can be incorporated on the fly as they come in without having to recalculate
 * the past.
 *
 * @subsection kalmanoverview Overview
 *
 * You need your <b>linear model function</b> in matrix form, initial values at \f$T=0\f$ and a second <b>model that relates
 * observations</b> to the internal states. If the model describes the measured parameters directly, this is the identity matrix.
 * You supply an <b>initial trust</b> in the initial states, and this matrix will be propagated as error estimation.
 * Furthermore, you assign a level of <b>trust in the model function</b>, and a level of <b>trust in the measurements</b>.
 *
 * @subsection kalmanalgorithm Algorithm
 *
 * The Kalman filter solves the following set of recursive equations:
 *
 * _Prediction_:
 * \f[
 * \hat{x}_k=A\hat{x}_{k-1} + B u_k
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * P_k = A P_{k-1}A^T+Q
 * \f]
 * _Update_:
 * \f[
 * K_k = P_k H^T(H P_k H^T + R)^{-1}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * \hat{x}_k = \hat{x}_k + K_k(\hat{z}_k - H\hat{x}_k)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * P_k = (I - K_k H)P_k
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$\hat{x}_k\f$ is the model value at time step \f$k\f$, \f$A\f$ is the model itself, i. e. the system transformation matrix,
 * \f$u_k\f$ is a control signal that is related to the states via \f$B\f$, \f$P\f$ is an error estimation, and \f$Q\f$ is the covariance
 * matrix of the process noise. Furthermore, \f$\hat{z}_k\f$ is the observation at time step \f$k\f$, \f$K\f$ denotes the Kalman gain,
 * \f$H\f$ is the observation model relating observations to the states, \f$R\f$ is the observation covariance matrix, and \f$I\f$ is
 * the identity. For details see Ref. [AM+02] equations (8)-(16).
 *
 * @note These statistical methods stem mostly from robotics, where the state tracking is used to narrow down the position of a vehicle
 * given noisy secondary measurements. In contrast, see for example Ref. [SC06] for an assessment of snow data assimilation through an
 * (Ensemble) Kalman filter.
 *
 * @subsection kalmanexample Example: Sensor fusion
 *
 * Let's start with a real-world example and work through the settings.
 * @note This example is exercised in the `/doc/examples/statistical_filters.cc` program to follow along.
 *
 * At Innsbruck's Seegrube, there is a spot were two stations from different owners are situated right next to each other.
 * Of course they both measure the air temperature and we want to use the Kalman filter to find the _most likely real temperature_.
 * @note The Kalman filter can only be used for linear models (that can be expressed in matrix form). It is only valid for Gaussian
 * measurement noise.
 *
 * @code
 * TA::FILTER1 = KALMAN
 * @endcode
 *
 * First, we need the heart of the problem, our <b>system model</b>. It describes the evolution of the states through time and is read from
 * the `STATE_DYNAMICS` key. This is the matrix A from above.
 * Matrices can be input in three different ways:
 * 1. A scalar that the matrix diagonal is filled with.
 * 2. A vector that is put on the diagonal.
 * 3. A complete matrix.
 * Matrices and vectors are input by a list of comma-separated elements. To init both a vector that is 4 elements long or a matrix that
 * is 2 by 2 you would write: `1, 0, 0, 1`. You can put brackets around your numbers for readability: `[1, 0][0, 1]`.
 *
 * We will use a most easy <b>model</b>:
 * @code
 * STATE_DYNAMICS = 1
 * @endcode
 * This means that we assume a constant temperature throughout our data window.
 * @note You can use the following substitutions in the system matrix:
 * 1. "dt" will be replaced with the normalized and scaled time delta between the current and the last measurement. At T=0, dt=0. At time
 * of the first observation, dt=1.
 * 2. "meteo(XX)" where "XX" stands for any meteo parameter present in the data set at this time, e. g. "meteo(TA)".
 *
 * Next, we need an <b>initial state</b>. We have two internal states (both of which are energy states), namely the two temperatures.
 * For both filters, you can provide the values as a list (e. g. `268, 271`). You can also leave all of them or some of them empty to make
 * MeteoIO pick the initial %state(s) from the 1st available observation(s). "1st" is a synonym for this. You can use the token "average" (case sensitive)
 * to let MeteoIO average over all 1st observations. We want the average between the first measurement of both stations so we write:
 * @code
 * INITIAL_STATE = [average, average]
 * @endcode
 * @note Other valid input formats would be to not use this key (to pick earliest observation for all states) or `[268, ]` (to set
 * the first state to 268 and pick the earliest measurement of the second observation variable for the 2nd state. Identical: `[268, 1st]`).
 * @note This is usually the line that fixes the number of states and thus the matrix sizes. MeteoIO will complain if they don't match,
 * but input errors could still lead to surprising results.
 * @note MeteoIO will handle cases where the user requests to choose initial values automatically, but nodata values are encountered. It will
 * search for the first valid dataset, and use this for the beginning of the measurement. If any one initial state encounters
 * nodata values only, an error is thrown. If the filter itself encounters nodata values a warning is displayed.
 * This makes it run but could have undesired side effects. As the number of nodata values increases, the results will
 * become more and more skewed. A warning will be displayed; you should resample beforehand.
 *
 * We have our states initialized and our state transition matrix ready. Now we need some <b>statistical quantities</b>.
 * We provide the trust in the initial state via the `INITIAL_TRUST` key. This inputs the matrix `P` from above. <i>Set low values if you
 * don't trust \f$\hat{x}_0\f$, and very high ones if you do</i>. Let's not worry about it too much and pick a not very trusty 1 at the diagonal:
 * @code
 * INITIAL_TRUST = 1
 * @endcode
 * @note Other valid input formats that do exactly the same would be `[1, 0] [0, 1]` (full matrix), `[1, 1]` (diagonal vector), or
 * `1, 1` (you do not need brackets).
 *
 * Next, we need the <b>covariance of the process noise</b> (noise in the model function by external forces acting on the state variables).
 * A poor process model might be mitigated by injecting enough uncertainty here. We don't have knowledge of any specific process
 * disturbances but we know that our model is quite crude, so we _inject a bit of uncertainty in the model_:
 * @code
 * PROCESS_COVARIANCE = 0.05
 * @endcode
 * @note The above line will construct this 2x2-matrix: `[0.05, 0][0, 0.05]`.
 *
 * We now have everything regarding the system model. On to the _observations_.
 *
 * The matrix \f$H\f$ from above is the <b>observation model</b> relating our measurements to the internal states. In our case, we measure
 * the temperatures which are also our internal states, so there is nothing to do. We can however decide how much each station contributes
 * to the estimate. Let's trust both stations the same:
 * @code
 * OBSERVATION_RELATION = [1, 1]
 * @endcode
 * Next, the matrix \f$R\f$ which is the observation covariance. Let's assume a standard deviation sigma of 0.8, i. e. the uncertainty of the
 * sensor is somewhere around 0.8 °C and we put the variance (sigma squared) on the diagonal:
 * @code
 * OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE = 0.64
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note If \f$Q\f$ and \f$R\f$ are time invariant then \f$P\f$ and \f$K\f$ will stabilize quickly, cf. Fig. 5 (they could even be computed offline).
 *
 * Only thing missing is a list of parameters that stand for the states. The filter runs on `TA` which is the first state, and we want
 * the second one to be `TA_HYD`. By default, MeteoIO will only filter `TA` in the output file. This is to comply with all other filters and avoid
 * unexpected results. We can set however that all observations that are filtered internally are also filtered in the meteo set:
 * @code
 * ADD_OBSERVABLES       = TA_HYD
 * FILTER_ALL_PARAMETERS = TRUE
 * @endcode
 * Note that we require the number of observables to be equal to the number of states, simply to avoid having to set how
 * many, and which, observables to output. You must supply them, but you can easily discard them (e. g. by leaving
 * `FILTER_ALL_PARAMETERS = FALSE` or by designing your matrices in a way that they zero out).
 *
 * <b>Important:</b> For technical reasons, filtering other parameters than the one the filter runs on only works as expected
 * when the Kalman filter is the last filter that is applied!
 *
 * @note If you want to output all filtered parameters but also keep the originals you can simply use MeteoIO's `COPY` command.
 *
 * The complete ini section now reads:
 * @code
 * [FILTERS]
 * TA::FILTER1                          =   KALMAN
 * TA::ARG1::STATE_DYNAMICS             =   1
 * TA::ARG1::INITIAL_STATE              =   [average, average]
 * TA::ARG1::INITIAL_TRUST              =   1
 * TA::ARG1::PROCESS_COVARIANCE         =   0.05
 * TA::ARG1::ADD_OBSERVABLES            =   TA_HYD
 * TA::ARG1::FILTER_ALL_PARAMETERS      =   TRUE
 * TA::ARG1::OBSERVATION_RELATION       =   1
 * TA::ARG1::OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE     =   0.6
 * @endcode
 *

 *
 * @subsection kalmanexampletunnel Example: Vehicle entering a tunnel
 *
 * Let's tackle an accessible non-meteo standard problem for a Kalman filter to help understand the input mechanics better.
 * Suppose a car enters a tunnel and can still reliably measure its speed, but not its position.
 *
 * @code
 * XX::FILTER1 = KALMAN
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The program in `/doc/examples/statistical_filters.cc` fakes
 * noisy measurements of the velocity in x-direction (a constant true speed plus noise) and MeteoIO will read this in the `SPEED` parameter.
 *
 * This is our model for the position and (constant) speed:
 * \f[
 * x_t = x_{t-1} + \frac{\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}}{\mathrm{d}t} * dt
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * \frac{\mathrm{d}x_t}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}}{\mathrm{d}t}
 * \f]
 *
 * @note As mentioned earlier, in this implementation you need to provide observation fields for all states. Even if we
 * do not measure either of the position coordinates fields must be created for them so that MeteoIO can output all (filtered)
 * internal states. In this case they can be viewed as internal calculations and be discarded if we're only interested in
 * the velocity.
 * @note Our car travels only in `x`-direction and \f$v_y\f$ remains zero.
 *
 * @code
 * [INPUT]
 * XX::CREATE             =        CST
 * XX::CST::VALUE         =        0
 * YY::CREATE             =        CST
 * YY::CST::VALUE         =        0
 * VX::COPY               =        SPEED ;preserve original
 * VY::CREATE             =        CST
 * VY::CST::VALUE         =        0
 * @endcode
 *
 * We fix our <b>state vector</b> to be ordered `[position in x, position in y, speed in x, speed in y]`:
 * \f[
 * \hat{x}=\left( \begin{array}{c}
 * x \\
 * y \\
 * v_x \\
 * v_y \end{array} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * Therefore, the <b>system model</b> can be written in matrix form such that \f$\hat{x}_t = A\hat{x}_{t-1}\f$:
 * \f[
 * A=\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 * 1 & 0 & dt & 0 \\
 * 0 & 1 & 0 & dt \\
 * 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 * 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * To <b>select the measured velocities</b> we design H to be:
 * \f[
 * H=\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 * 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 * 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 * 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 * 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)
 * \f]
 * Keep in mind that we are only measuring the velocities, not the positions, so only the velocities can play a role in the
 * new state estimation (Eq. 2 of update step). The initial values are position \f$(0, 0)\f$ and speed \f$(x_0, 0)\f$, and we pick the first measured
 * speed as initial value:
 *
 * @code
 * STATE_DYNAMICS       = [1, 0, dt, 0][0, 1, 0, dt][0, 0, 1, 0][0, 0, 0, 1]
 * INITIAL_STATE        = [0, 0, 1st, 0]
 * OBSERVATION_RELATION = [0, 0, 0, 0][0, 0, 0, 0][0, 0, 1, 0][0, 0, 0, 1]
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Once again, in this case we could internally use 2 measurements only \f$(v_x, v_y)\f$; `H` could then be a 2x4-matrix,
 * `R` could be a 2x2-matrix and the formulas would still work out. However, since all states are propagated anyway it is
 * next to no penalty to work with square matrices and output them all.
 *
 * With our states ordered the way they are the filter must run on `x` so that this is also internally the first
 * observable. Then we match the rest of our <b>vector ordering</b>:
 *
 * @code
 * ADD_OBSERVABLES = YY VX VY
 * @endcode
 *
 * With some <b>covariances</b> (we have a perfect model now) and error output the whole ini section reads like so:
 * @code
 * FILTER1                    =   KALMAN
 * STATE_DYNAMICS             =   [1, 0, dt, 0][0, 1, 0, dt][0, 0, 1, 0][0, 0, 0, 1]
 * INITIAL_STATE              =   [0, 0, 1st, 0]
 * INITIAL_TRUST              =   10
 * PROCESS_COVARIANCE         =   0
 * ADD_OBSERVABLES            =   YY VX VY
 * FILTER_ALL_PARAMETERS      =   TRUE
 * OBSERVATION_RELATION       =   [0, 0, 0, 0][0, 0, 0, 0][0, 0, 1, 0][0, 0, 0, 1]
 * OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE     =   10
 * OUT_ESTIMATED_ERROR        =   ERR1 ERR2 ERR3 ERR4
 * OUT_ERROR_AS_STDDEV        =   TRUE
 * @endcode
 *
 * \image html kalmanfilter_velocity.png "Fig. 4: The measured velocity is all over the place, but the filtered one quickly stabilizes to the true speed (10 m/s). With a perfect model like this the secondary estimation of the position is almost linear like it should be."
 *
 * @subsection kalmanfeatures Other features
 *
 * @subsubsection kalmancontrol Control signal input
 *
 * With `CONTROL_SIGNAL` you can input an _external control signal acting on the states_ (the vector \f$\hat{u}\f$ from above)
 * in three different ways:
 * 1. A scalar (e. g. `0.2`) that an appropriate vector is filled with.
 * 2. A vector (e. g. `[0.1, 0.2]`) which will be applied for all time steps.
 * 3. A list of meteo parameters holding the value for each timestep (e. g. `UU1 UU2`), i. e. a time-variant vector.
 * The matrix \f$H\f$ is applied to this vector and can be input via `CONTROL_RELATION` as usual.
 *
 * @subsubsection kalmanerror Error estimation
 *
 * `OUT_ESTIMATED_ERROR` lets you pick one or more field names that the filter will output the _evolution of the diagonal elements of
 * the error estimation_ \f$P\f$ to. Considering the diagonal elements to be variances you can also take the square root
 * of this value for convenience with the `OUT_ERROR_AS_STDDEV` key.
 * @code
 * OUT_ESTIMATED_ERROR = ERR1 ERR2 ;2 states
 * OUT_ERROR_AS_STDDEV = TRUE
 * @endcode
 * If you have two states, you need two parameter names (that will be created).
 *
 * \image html kalmanfilter_errorestimation.png "Fig. 5: Diagonal components of the error estimation matrix from the velocity example: the estimated position becomes more and more unreliable, while with each new measurement the speed becomes more and more certain."
 *
 * @subsubsection kalmanvariances Time-variant covariance matrices
 *
 * With `PROCESS_COVARIANCE_PARAMS` and `OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE_PARAMS` you can supply a list of parameters that \f$Q\f$ and \f$R\f$
 * are read from, i. e. time-variant covariance matrices. This has priority over a fixed matrix that is found in
 * `PROCESS_COVARIANCE` and `OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE`, respectively.
 * They can only be _input as vectors_ that will be put on a matrix diagonal with the rest being 0. For this you need one meteo parameter
 * per vector element (state) and you need to name the parameters with `PROCESS_COVARIANCE_PARAMS` and `OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE_PARAMS`.
 * @code
 * PROCESS_COVARIANCE_PARAMS = COV_P1 COV_P2 //if either is missing, this key will be ignored
 * OBSERVATION_COVARIANCE_PARAMS = COV_O1 COV_O2
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsubsection kalmanverbose Suppression of warnings
 *
 * The `VERBOSE` keyword can be used to enable/disable some warnings the filter shows in the console. This will normally concern missing
 * input that was defaulted or something similar. _Usually you will want to get rid of all of them_, but if the filter must be quiet no
 * matter what then you can set `VERBOSE = FALSE`.
 *
 * @subsubsection kalmannotes Further notes
 *
 * - While matrices are input as comma-separated values, other lists are read from a space delimited line (e. g. `PROCESS_COVARIANCE_PARAMS = COV1 COV2 COV3`).
 * - You may find MeteoIO's `[DATASOURCEXXX]` command to read multiple input files and stream them to the same container
 * useful to combine meteo data and model input.
 * - <b>Important:</b> For technical reasons all filters can run on a larger time frame than is
 * requested in the getMeteoData call. This allows windowed filters to have enough data even at the beginning and end to do
 * their work and is controlled by the `BUFF_BEFORE` and `BUFFER_SIZE` keys. If you set both to 0 then the filters receive
 * exactly the time frame covered by the input dates. However, if you are using windowed filters also, then these will lack
 * data. This is important in understanding how the initial states are picked: if MeteoIO inits the states automatically with
 * the first available data point then this is taken from the first point MeteoIO sees. Thus, with a large enough buffer the model will
 * start at a much earlier date and initial states are also picked a while before the input start date. Additionally, if there
 * are nodata elements in there then even if they would be ignored for the output they would make the filters display warnings.
 * You have to be careful to either start your analytical model at the date `data window - buffer`, or ideally provide exactly
 * the same amount of data on the file system as you request MeteoIO to filter.
